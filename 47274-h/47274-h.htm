<h2 class="p2">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="p2">We have sought to gather into this little volume,
a few of the incidents that are prominent in the
History of Company K, as they have presented themselves
to us, after the facts related have passed almost
beyond recall. We have been obliged, for the sake of
brevity, to omit much that might have been recorded,
and to give only that, which we think should be preserved
in some way.</p>

<p>Our Children, and Children's children, as they scan
these pages in the days to come, may proudly boast
of ancestors, who were among "The Boys who fought
at Gettysburg their own home."</p>

<p>We are aware that inaccuracies and imperfections
will be found in the book, for while the collecting of
material has been in progress for quite a while, the editing
and compiling, has come upon us in the midst of
other cares and duties, in our chosen walk of life.</p>

<p>We trust our labor will not be in vain, but that our
little volume will be appreciated and preserved, by
those still in life, who remember the scene and experience
so imperfectly set forth, as well as by their pasterity,
through all time to come.</p>

<p>We have already commenced the revision of this
volume, and propose soon to publish a larger and revised
edition; and, therefore, I ask all comrades who
may find errors in the present edition, to acquaint me
at once of the fact, that such errors may be corrected.</p>

<h3 class="p2">INTRODUCTORY.</h3>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i017.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="It" title="" /> is our purpose, to write a brief
History of Company K. First
(Inft,) Penn'a Reserves.</p>

<p>The history of a Company, as
duty was performed by such command,
in the War of the Rebellion,
must needs be the History
of the Regiment, Brigade and Division
to which such company belonged.</p>

<p>It is not a part of our plan, to add laurels to those
really won by the company, or to burnish the character
of any member thereof, for the record is already made,
and this Company needs no boosting into popular favor
at this late day.</p>

<p>That the History of the company and of its heroes,
may be put into tangible form for distribution and
preservation, as well as that a book of reference may
be put in the hands of the survivors and their families,
is our only object.</p>

<p>Company K. First Penn'a Reserves, takes no second
place among the companies that went out from the
County of Adams, though other companies performed
good and noble service.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
Organization of the Company.</h3>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i019.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="On" /> the 15th day of May, 1861, a
Bill was passed by both branches
of the Penn'a Legislature, received
the Governor's signature, and became
a law of the commonwealth,
authorizing the organization of a
military corps, to be called, the
Reserve volunteer corps, to be
composed of Thirteen regiments of Infantry, One of
Cavalry and One of Artillery, to be mustered into the
State service, and to be liable to be mustered into the
service of the United States at any time. (See Bill.)</p>

<p>In response to orders issued to local military organizations
in the state, the "Adams county infantry," of
Gettysburg, accepted the call. The ranks were filled
to the maximum number, in a few days, from all parts
of the county, and was officered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Edward McPherson, Captain; J. Finley Bailey, 1st
Lieut; J. J. Herron, 2nd Lieut.</p>

<p>We rendezvoused at Gettysburg on Friday June 7.
1861, having been accepted by Gov. Curtin, under the
provisions of the Bill above recorded.</p>

<p>On Saturday June 8th, at 7:30 a. m. the command
took the train, and proceeded to Camp Wayne, at
Westchester, Pa., where a Camp was organized under
charge of Capt. H. M. McIntire, as a rendezvous, for
a portion of the Reserve corps.</p>

<p>We reached Camp at 6:30 p. m. and entered upon
an experience, which few suspected would last for the
whole term of three years.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="100" height="145" alt="An" /> Organization was effected, by the
appointment of non-Commissioned
officers, on Tuesday June 11th
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>W. W. Stewart, 1st Sergeant, and
J. J. Duey, Peter H. Henry, and
H. N. Minnigh, Sergeants, in the
order named; also, the following Corporals:&mdash;J. D.
Sadler, P. L. Houck, Jacob Resser and D. D. Bailey.</p>

<p>The Record will prove whether these were judicious
selections or not.</p>

<p>"After muster into the State service, our progress in
the drill was so marked, that Col. Roberts, on account
of the character of the men and their proficiency, selected
us as Company B, of the Regiment," says Capt.
McPherson in a recent letter, "an assignment which
was overruled by Gen'l McCall, when the regiment
reached Washington. The Union guards of Lancaster,
which had originally been Co. B, was thereby restored
and we were made, as at first, Co. K, which position
had naturally fallen to us, having been the last company
of those forming the First regiment, that arrived
in camp."</p>

<p>Well! we have the consciousness today, that as a
company we were not inferior to any other command
in the regiment, and Company K. never did and never
will, ask for unmerited favors.</p>

<p>On June 18, a slashing and cutting affray took place
in camp, for on that day a general vaccination of the
members of the company was ordered. Probably the
Surgeon wanted to get a little practice. He got there.</p>

<p>June 20, the ladies of our native county, sent us a
full complement of Havelocks, and a useless appendage
they were. Barney D. said, they were "Moighty
noice to corrie me tobaccy in." We sent home thanks
and threw the "head-bags" away.</p>

<p>Drill, drill, drill! was the order of the camp, and
we soon became proficient in all company movements,
principally under the command of Lieut. Bailey.</p>

<p>Col. Roberts took command of the Regiment, and
also of the camp, on June 20th, and on the 21st, Capt.
McPherson visited Gettysburg, returning on the 25th,
bringing five recruits for the company, which added to
the 69 who had passed the examination previously,
increased our number to 74.</p>

<p>June 28th, we again received a donation from home,
consisting of needle-cases, which were very convenient,
but one of the boys said, he wished his sister, or somebody
else's sister, had come along to do his mending.</p>

<p>On Monday, July 1st, the regiment was partly uniformed;
white duck pants and flannel shirts, furnished
by the state, and a fancy gray Jacket, sent from home,
while Caps and Overcoats, were issued by the government;
arms and accoutrements, were also distributed.</p>

<p>"The Glorious Fourth," came on, and with it came
an invitation to a neighboring grove, where the good
people of Westchester furnished us with a No. 1. dinner.
After dinner the "shoulder straps" gallanted the girls,
while the "low private" soldiers looked on, or perhaps
thought of "The girl I left behind me." Some took a
bathe in the Brandywine.</p>

<p>July 5th, an order was issued, requiring all companies
to be filled up to the maximum number, by recruiting
officers, sent out for that purpose. It should have
been stated before, that at the original examination, a
number of men had been rejected, on account of physical
defects, even the slightest, as only men of perfect
physique were taken to fill the quota.</p>

<p>Sergeants Stewart and Minnigh were detailed accordingly,
leaving camp on the 8th, and returning on the
19th, with twenty recruits, who were mustered in on
that date, increasing our numbers to 94 all told.</p>

<p>While we still lacked seven of the full quota, the
very best material, however, composed this command,
men of muscle, nerve, and courage, as well as brain,
men of whom Gov. Curtin could well say, "They are
the flower of the state." All volunteers, none forced
into service, no bummers, no bounty-jumpers.</p>

<p>Another fact should be stated here; the men in the
ranks were not inferior, in physique or social standing
to the officers. Hence, the duty performed, and the
work done by this command.</p>

<p>Every battle-field on which the Army of the Potomac
was engaged, from Mechanicsville, June 26. 1862,
to Bethesda church, June 30. 1864, drank of the noblest
blood, the state could afford, when these men fell.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
"On To The Front."</h3>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i024.jpg" width="100" height="140" alt="C" />amp Wayne was left behind, on
July 21st, when the First regiment
with other Reserve troops, were
ordered to rendezvous at Harrisburg,
on their way to the front.</p>

<p>All along the way, from the latter
place, the people were in the
rage of excitement, owing to the disaster at Bull-run,
the previous day, (21st,) and when we reached Baltimore,
a delegation of the city authorities and police,
waited on Col. Roberts, who was in command of all
troops then moving to the front, and urged him not to
attempt a passage through the city. Our commanders
characteristic reply was, "Gentlemen! we have not
come down here hunting for safe places, my men are
thoroughly equipped, and will march through the city."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd, we advanced through
the city, the only peculiarity, noticeable, being the
scarcity of Baltimore fire-eaters and plug-uglies.</p>

<p>Having passed through the heart of the city without
any disturbance whatever, we camped on Carroll Hill,
in the suburbs, and here on the 24th of July, we were
mustered into the U. S. Service, for three years or during
the war.</p>

<p>July 26th, the non-Commissioned officers were increased
to 5 sergeants, and 8 corporals, A. L. C.
Woods being appointed 5th sergeant, and S. A. Young,
I. N. Durboraw, I. M. Brandon and H. W. Caufman,
5th, 6th, 7th and 8th corporals, respectively.</p>

<p>On the 28th, we left this camp, and marched toward
Washington D. C. but at Annapolis Junction we, with
three other companies of the regiment, went into camp,
while the ballance of the regiment went to Annapolis.</p>

<p>Lieut. Herron resigned on the 14th, and Capt. McPherson
on the 24th of August; an election was accordingly
held, and resulted in the promotion of W. W.
Stewart, to 1st Lieut. and J. D. Sadler, to 2nd Lieut.
while Lieut. Bailey was made Captain in the regular
line of promotion.</p>

<p>On August 30th, we moved with the regiment, to
camp Tennally, north west of Wasington city, and at
no great distance from the same.</p>

<p>Here a general promotion of non-commissioned
officers took place, and when finished, they stood in
the following order on the company rolls.</p>

<p>H. N. Minnigh, Orderly Serg't, J. J. Duey, P. H.
Henry, A. L. C. Woods and P. L. Houck, Sergeants
in the order named. S. A. Young, I. N. Durboraw,
I. M. Brandon, H. W. Caufman, C. Z. Tawney, Geo.
E. Kitzmiller, H. Knox Danner and Jacob Resser,
Corporals.</p>

<p>Eight recruits joined the company and were mustered
in Sep't 3rd, beside these, only six others ever joined
the company, and they came and were mustered in on
Sep't 4th, 1862. (See roll.)</p>

<p>September 16th, the Penn'a Reserves, were fully organized
as a Division, with Gen'l Geo. A. McCall as
Division commander, and Gen'l Jno. F. Reynolds, in
command of the First Brigade, to which Brigade our
Regiment was attached.</p>

<p>And now followed many weary days, consisting of
Company, Regimental and Brigade drill, also, daily
details of men, who assisted in building Fort Pennsylvania,
erected by the Reserves, an occasional review
or "<span class="smcap"><span class="spaced">Fall in</span></span>," which merely meant an exhaustive
standing in line for hours together, "the divil knows
phwat fore," said Barney, none of which was much
enjoyed by the boys, who were eager to cross the Potomac,
whip the Jonnies, and then go home. Many
amusing things transpired at this camp, of which we
may speak later on.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
The Work of the Company.</h3>


<p>With Chapter Fourth, we enter upon the Second
division of our projected plan, viz., "The
work of the company."</p>

<p>October 9th, we crossed the Potomac river, and entered
upon the "sacred soil of Virginia," and formed
a winter camp at Langley, known as Camp Pierpont.</p>

<p>Here we tried to be comfortable, but the severe exposure
with constant camp and picket duty, wrought
upon the men who never knew else, than to live under
the sheltering roofs of comfortable homes, "up in the
north-land."</p>

<p>November 26. Jesse Shank, of York Springs, Pa,
and December 4, Geo. W. Myers, of the same place,
died, and were sent home for burial. But the winter
wore away, and weary of the monotonous routine of
duty, we waited eagerly for the spring-time, and the
anticipated forward movement.</p>

<p>March 10, we broke camp and joined in the advance
of the Army of the Potomac, under Gen'l G. B.
McClellan, and on the evening of the first days march,
camped at Hunter's Mill, Va.</p>

<p>We stayed here three days, and then moved in the
direction of Alexandria, where we arrived, through
rain and mud, and went into camp, the advance movement
having developed the fact, that the confederate
army had abandoned Manasses and gone southward.</p>

<p>April 9th, we moved forward on the line of the Orange
&amp; Alex'a R. R. by way of Manasses and Warrenton
junctions, to Catlett's station, and finally down
the north bank of the Rappahannock river to Falmouth
opposite Fredericksburg, where we encamped.</p>

<p>May 26th, we crossed the river, and took possession
of that city, encamping on the heights westward.</p>

<p>This, and the former camp at Falmouth, were decidedly
the pleasantest camps in our three years service.</p>

<p>On June 8th, the Division was ordered to join McClellan's
forces on the peninsula. We accordingly embarked
at Bell's landing on the 9th, and after a voyage
of 20 hours, disembarked at White-house landing on
the Pamunkey river. After various marches and counter-marches
we finally encamped on June 18th, on the
extreme right of the army, near Mechanicsville.</p>

<p>And now came the famous Seven days Battles, the
very thought of which, causes an involuntary tremor
to pass through the whole being, days of horror and
bloodshed, of humiliation and death. We cannot even
hope to give an adequate portrayal of these horrors.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
Battle of Mechanicsville.</h3>


<p>The 26th of June, found the command on the
Picket line, from which we were hurriedly recalled,
only to find our camp had disappeared
and our private property gone "where the woodbine
twineth," but in time to take our place in line with
other troops, who were ready to meet the confederates,
who were reported as advancing in our immediate
front. We were ordered by special detail with our Regiment,
to support Cooper's battery. I need not write
up this battle in full detail, for those <i>who were there</i>,
remember well, the onward rush of the enemy, how
two whole divisions under Gen'l Lee, (a fact developed
more recently,) at 3 p. m. threw themselves upon our
line, only to be hurled back amid great slaughter, how
amid the shriek of shell and flashing musketry they
still advanced, how our 58 caliber elongated balls now
for the first time were sent on missions of death, and
with what execution, how Craig Wisotskey fell, and in
few moments expired, one limb being literally torn
from the body, when Hamilton and Siplinger were
wounded and assisted from the field, how at length the
shades of night fell, putting an end to the conflict.</p>

<p>There was no movement of troops in the Union lines,
the men stood in their places and poured an uninterrupted
fire upon the enemy, while the artillery, fifty
pieces, rained solid shot, shells, canister and sharpnell,
producing great slaughter. The total Union loss in this
battle was eighty killed and two hundred wounded,
while the Rebel loss was three thousand.</p>

<p>We slept on our arms that night, and at the early
dawn we were withdrawn, contrary to the wishes of
the Reserves who had held the ground against five
times their number, but we did not then know that
Jackson had come from the Shenandoah with 40,000
men, and was in our rear.</p>

<p>The forces north of the Chickahominy took up a new
position at Gaines' mill, sometimes called Gaines' hill,
and by the rebels, Coal Harbor. Gen'l Porter is in
command with 40,000 men while Gen'l Lee is coming
on with 70,000, he intends to make a grand onset and
sweep Porter into the Chickahominy. Three o'clock
of the 27th, has come and the attack is made, amid
cannonry and the angry flashes of musketry, while the
battle cloud becomes thick and heavy. It would take
many pages to make a full record of the terrible battle.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock we were ordered to the support of the
Duryea Zouaves, which regiment had been almost annihilated.
We checked the enemy and held the line
until every cartridge is gone, when we were relieved.
Just behind the front line we halted, when a charge by
the enemy broke the Union line, and a mass of disorganized
troops came rushing back. It was at this juncture
Gen'l Porter said, "Col. Roberts, can't you form
a line and stop those flying troops?" to which our
brave Colonel responded, "I can Gen'l, but send me
ammunition to stop the enemy." Steadily as if on dress
parade, the regiment faced fleeing friends, halted the
disorganized mass, rallied them under its colors, and
then with fixed bayonet awaited the onset. But cheers
are heard coming from our rear, the tramp of some
body of troops hurrying forward, and the famous Irish
Brigade push onward with long and steady step, they
check the enemy and drive him back, the day is won,
and quiet is restored again.</p>

<p>We crossed to the south side of the Chickahominy
during the night, and joined the general retreat toward
the James river, the Division having charge of all
the ammunition and other trains. This consumed our
time till the evening of the 29th, when the command
is sent out on the road leading from Charles' city to
Richmond, west of our line of retreat, this being the
most dangerous line of approach from the confederate
side. All remember that terrible night while on picket
duty, for it was soon discovered that a large force
of the enemy were quietly concentrating in our front.
At day light we fell back to the line of battle composed
of the division of Penn'a Reserves, who were in
advance of all other troops, and awaited the onset.</p>

<p>Half-past two o'clock came, and then Hill with six
brigades of his own and six of Longstreets command,
hurled the whole force upon our front. Brigade after
brigade advanced, but recoiled under the direct fire
of the batteries, sustained by the infantry.</p>

<p>"Volley after volley streamed across our front and
in such quick succession that it seemed impossible for
any human being to live under it," writes a Rebel officer.
"Use the bayonet only," is our standing order,
as counter-charges are directed against the enemy,
and thus for three hours the battle rages, sustained
wholly by McCall's division of less than six thousand
men, and Hill has not driven him an inch.</p>

<p>It was then that J. Finley Bailey our brave Captain
was last seen, and strange as it may seem, no has ever
been found who knew aught of his fate. Lieut. Stewart
was wounded while acting adjutant of the regiment,
while nine men were wounded and eight taken
prisoner. The Irish brigade again came to the rescue,
at about sunset, and under cover of the night, we fell
back to the James river at Malvern Hill, in a state of
complete exhaustion and despondency.</p>

<p>At the battle of Malvern hill, our command took no
active part, but were held in reserve, the only time in
our recollection that we held such a position.</p>

<p>It may be said here, and the statistics proves the
fact, that the Penn'a Reserves sustained a loss during
the seven days battles, of one-fifth of the total loss,
while our strength was only one-fifteenth of the total
strength, and this fact does not find a parallel, in any
campaign or any battle, of any division of the federal
army, east or west.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
At Harrison's Landing.</h3>


<p>But the campaign is ended, and on July 3rd,
we go into camp at Harrison's landing, six
miles down the James river.</p>

<p>Here we suffer many hardships on account of inferior
rations and unwholesome water, producing malarious
and chronic diseases, and this we endured for forty-two
days.</p>

<p>A regular promotion of company officers took place
here, as follows:&mdash;W. W. Stewart to be Captain, J.
D. Sadler, 1st Lieut. and H. N. Minnigh, 2nd Lieut.
Sadler was in command Stewart being absent wounded.</p>

<p>August the 15th, we took the lead in the evacuation
of the Peninsula, and embarked on the steamer Rob't
Morrison, for the avowed purpose of joining Pope's
army before Washington. We landed at Aquia creek,
on the 19th, and proceeding thence by way of Fredericksburg,
and at Warrenton junction, we fell in with
Pope's forces, hurrying back toward the National capitol,
with the rebel horde at his heels.</p>

<p>We reached Bull Run on the 29th, and found that
a portion of the rebel army had beat us in the race,
but by a flank movement we passed them, took up a
position on the old battle ground, skirmished back and
forth one whole day, and waited eagerly the coming
of McClellan's army.</p>

<p>After a brave and obstinate contest, lasting all day
on the 30th, in which a victory should have been won,
but was lost through the defection and petty jealousies
of some leading officers, the Union forces yielded the
ground and fell back toward Washington.</p>

<p>On the night of Sep't 1st, we picketed on the flank
of the army camped at Centreville, then joined in the
general retreat and finally went into camp at Upton's
hill, near Alexandria.</p>

<p>September 6th, we moved across the Long Bridge,
through Washington city, to Leesboro, Md. where we
went into camp.</p>

<p>The Rebel army under Gen'l Lee, has crossed the
Potomac near Point of Rocks, and it is his intention
to "liberate Maryland, and invade Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>His plan is to hold the gaps across South Mountain,
and push his army north through the rich and beautiful
Cumberland valley, "cut his way to Philadelphia,
and dictate terms of peace in Independence Square."</p>

<p>On September 14th, the Union army found the enemy
well posted on the mountain twelve miles west of
Frederick city, and four miles from Middletown, and
the Union veterans of the Peninsula, hurried up to
meet him. Reaching the foot of the mountain after a
hurried march, we file to the right, then face to the
front, and begin the ascent of the mountain. Onward,
upward we sweep, like a great tidal wave, the foot of
the last acclivity is reached, then with a cheer, we
cross the stone wall in our front, and with a rush up
through the corn field, then a short, desperate, decisive
struggle, and the battle of South Mountain is won.</p>

<p>Lieut. J. D. Sadler in command of the company fell
while gallantly leading his men in this charge, and at
the same moment Jere. Naylor and Peter Miller, were
killed, while Lieut. H. N. Minnigh and several men
were wounded, leaving the company without a commissioned
officer, Capt. Stewart still being absent, on
account of wounds.</p>

<p>On September 17th, the command was at Antietam,
and took its place in line, though the company only
numbered ten or twelve men for duty, and were led by
Serg't Kitzmiller, and fortunately no casualties occurred,
during that terrible struggle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
Forward once more.</h3>


<p>The company has now been in active service
one year, and the ranks are reduced from
94 to a mere guard of 30 present for duty, not
one-third of the number is left, while the Penn'a Reserves,
by the fatalities of warfare are reduced from the
original 15,000 to barely 4,000 for duty.</p>

<p>The command went into camp near Sharpsburg,
where 2nd Lieut. Minnigh was promoted to 1st Lieut.
and Serg't Kitzmiller to 2nd Lieut. and Capt. Stewart
returned to the company from Gen'l Hospital.</p>

<p>Breaking camp once more on October 30th, we re-crossed
the Potomac at Berlin ferry, going southward,
through Lovettsville, Warrenton, Rappahannock station,
and finally go into camp at Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>While here, and before the Fredericksburg campaign
opened, Co. K, was detailed on special duty at
Brooks' station, on the Aquia creek rail-road, and as
a consequence did not participate in the Battle of the
10th of December, in which the Penn'a Reserves once
more distinguished themselves, making a charge, that
for dash and daring, has not a parallel in the entire
history of the war. Of this charge a distinguished
writer says, "They broke through two well entrenched
lines of the enemy, and accomplished what was expected
of them, but for want of support they were compeled
to retire." The loss in this assault was 176 killed,
1197 wounded and 468 missing, a total loss of 1841,
out of a possible 4500, two-fifths of the total loss reported
in said battle. The detail of the company with the
ambulance corps, did duty on the field.</p>

<p>On February 8th, the whole command was relieved
from the front, and transferred to the defences of the
city of Washington, to afford an opportunity, it was
said, to recruit our decimated ranks and wasted energies,
but as the event proved, in the 1st Regiment at
least, to perform more arduous duty than we had done
when with the main army. Our camp was located on
the north bank of the historic Bull-run, and finally at
Fairfax court-house. It was here the famous Photo
of company K. was taken, June 4th, 1863.</p>

<p>The battle of Chancellorsville, was fought on May
2nd, and when the Army of the Potomac followed on
the flank of Lee's forces which were moving northward,
we rejoined our old comrades, in pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Gettysburg.</span></h3>


<p>Having crossed the Potomac at Edward's ferry,
a continuous march on June 28, 29, 30 and July
1, and 2, brought us to Gettysburg our own native
town, and <span class="smcap">Home</span>. Before reaching Gettysburg we
heard various rumors of the investment of our home by
the enemy. One incident may be related here; When
approaching the familliar haunts of former days, and
some of the company began to recognize well known
faces, though themselves unknown, it was amusing to
note the surprise of the citizens, upon hearing their
names deliberately called out by the unknown soldiers.
One aged citizen when convinced of identity of his own
nephew, said "Vy Chon, for vat de defil you left dem
repel soljers gum up heyr, Hey?" John's reply was,
"Why! Uncle Sam, it was all planned out so that I
could get home to see my Mammy."</p>

<p>To lay joking aside, it was a serious matter to be
thus summoned in defence of our own homes. We had
gone out two years before, to conquer the enemy on
his own soil, but were now returning, after two years
of struggle, to meet him face to face at our own door.
What the feeling of each member of the company was,
under these circumstances, may be better imagined than
described, for we had seen enough of the ravages of
warfare in the south-land, to cause us to be anxious
for the welfare of our loved ones, now exposed in like
manner.</p>

<p>As we neared Gettysburg, in a number of instances
we passed near the homes of relatives and friends, but
with the merest greeting, the boys kept their places in
the ranks. Reaching the summit of the hill east of the
town, the members of the company, with a few exceptions,
could see their homes, in the village before them,
in the immediate vicinity or in the distance, and all of
them within the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>We reached Gettysburg on the morning of July 2nd,
coming from the direction of Hanover, and moving to
the left went into bivouac near the Baltimore pike, one
mile east of Cemetery ridge. Fatigued by the long
and weary marches, we soon were oblivious to all surroundings,
wrapped in restful slumber, unbroken even
by the terrible fighting at Culp's hill and Cemetery
ridge, on our immediate right and front.</p>

<p>About 4 o'clock we were hurriedly called into line,
and ordered to sling knapsacks, which command to us
always meant, "get ready for quick and devilish work,"
as "Snap" put it. We were hurried at a double quick
to the extreme left, at the Round tops, to re-inforce
the 3rd Corps, which had met with reverses and was
being driven by the enemy. Gen. Sykes' Regulars had
previously gone to the support of Sickles, but had also
yielded the ground. A terrible crisis was now seemingly
inevitable. The Regulars were the last to yield the
ground, but being flanked on their left, they broke
and fell back in disorder. At this juncture, we came
upon the ground. The First Brigade, formed hurriedly
in brigade front, as best they could, the nature of
the ground compelling the regiments to overlap each
other to some extent, on the crest of Little Round top,
facing the Wheat field. As we thus formed, we looked
down over the field of carnage, and could hear the
victorious shouts of the enemy, and when the smoke
of battle lifted momentarily, we caught glimpses of
fleeing friends and hotly pursuing foes, the general
outlook being anything but assuring.</p>

<p>We deliberately waited till the front was cleared of
our retreating and vanquished troops, many of whom
passed pell-mell through our ranks, then at the word
of command, with a ringing cheer, peculiarly our own,
we swept down the face of the hill, meeting the rebels
as they came rushing forward, on the face of the hill.
(I can only speak for my own regiment.) There can
be no doubt in any unprejudiced mind, that a few moments
delay would have lost to us the position on
Little Round Top, the key of the battle-field. The so
called historian of the battle-field, asserts that there
were no rebels in our front when we charged forward.
Nonsense! the evidence of those who were there, we
think, should have more weight than that of a mere
citizen hundreds of miles away from the field of strife.
Well, with a quick dash we swept down into the valley,
across Plum-run swamp, over the valley and up to the
stone fence, across this fence and through a narrow
strip of woods, (now removed,) to the eastern edge of
the wheat-field, where, by orders, we halted.</p>

<p>It has always been a source of amusement to the
"boys" who chased many a rabbit all over these hills,
and gathered berries in these valleys, played "hide
and seek" among these rocks and boulders, to be told
by strangers and pretenders, where we were, on the
evening of July 2nd, when the enemy had almost seized
this strong-hold, at the Round Tops.</p>

<p>The comrades will remember the commander of the
battery in our immediate front, who raved and swore,
when it seemed as if his guns would be taken.</p>

<p>"Dunder and blixen, don't let dem repels took my
batteries," were his earnest words of appeal, as the
enemy hurried up to the position occupied by his battery,
and how, the next morning he came over to the
stone wall and said, "The Pennsylvania Reserves
saved mine pattery, by&mdash;&mdash;. I gets you fellers all
drunk mit beer."</p>

<p>During the night of the 2nd, and all day of the 3rd
till Pickets' charge ended, we remained at the stone
wall, being compelled all the while to "lay low" on
account of rebel sharp-shooters in our immediate front.</p>

<p>Pickets charge having failed, Gen. Meade ordered
Crawford to clean out the woods in our front, and McCandles's
(our) brigade at the word of command, leaped
over the wall and deliberately dressed their lines.
Skirmishers were deployed to the front, right and left,
and the charge was made diagonally over the wheat-field
to the southwest, to the woods on the west side,
then half-wheeled to the right, then on up through the
woods to the crest of the hill, driving the enemy out
of the woods in the direction of the Peach-orchard.
The rebels at this juncture threatening our left flank,
the column changed direction by left flank to the rear,
and in this new direction we charged forward again.
Down through the low land, then up through the
woods east of the Rose house, surprising and capturing
many prisoners, over three thousand muskets, and the
colors of the Fifteenth Georgia regiment.</p>

<p>We bivouaced at night in the edge of Rose's woods,
and about noon being relieved, we moved back to the
stone wall, and then to the rear of Little Round Top,
where we went into bivouac, the battle being ended.</p>

<p>A few of the boys of Co. K, now went home, with or
without leave, and who will blame them, each one returning
in time to join in pursuit of the rebel horde as
they fled southward from Gettysburg.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
In pursuit of the rebels.</h3>


<p>We followed the enemy closely in his retreat,
keeping on his flank, and on July 11th,
found him entrenched at Williamsport, Md.
on the Potomac River.</p>

<p>On the 14th, when an advance was ordered upon
these works, they were found abandoned, the enemy
having re-crossed the river on the night of the 13th.</p>

<p>We followed on in due time, and soon found ourselves
once more, back on the old line of the Rappahannock
in Virginia, where after a most wearisome
campaign, we went into camp.</p>

<p>About the middle of October, the enemy made an
attempt to get between the federal forces and Washington
city, but Gen. Meade defeated his purposes,
and Lee went back to his old haunts beyond the Rapidan
river.</p>

<p>November 6th, the Mine-run campaign opened, but
beside constant skirmishing and several brisk battles,
by portions of the army, nothing of importance was
accomplished, and we returned to our old position on
December 2nd.</p>

<p>During the balance of the winter of '63, '64, we
were encamped at Bristow station, on the Orange and
Alexandria Rail-road, and guarded well a portion of
the line of communication.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />
The Wilderness campaign.</h3>


<p>April 29th, we pulled up stakes again, and
entered upon our last campaign. We broke
camp and marched to Warrenton, a distance
of thirty miles, and on the next morning continued on
in the direction of Culpepper, and rejoined our old
comrades of the main army, in the evening of that day.</p>

<p>We all knew that we were on the eve of an important
campaign, and one that would in all probability
close the war. The soldiers were very enthusiastic, and
had the utmost confidence in the two great commanders
who were to lead them.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May there was great excitement in
camp, and all anxiously waited for orders to move.
The army had been reinforced, and everything now
appeared to be in readiness to commence the campaign
that was to end the war.</p>

<p>Directly after mid-night, May 4th. the reveille was
beat, and was heard echoing and re-echoing all along
the line of camps, and soon after the great movement
against the rebel capitol had begun. Our corps (the
Fifth) moved in the direction of Germania ford on the
Rapidan river, and having crossed at that point, we
marched until four o'clock in the afternoon, when we
halted for the night, having marched fully thirty miles.
Our camp for the night was in the vicinity of the Wilderness
tavern. About sunrise on the 5th we continued
the march but had not gone far, when we found the
enemy in our front. Preparation was immediately
made to give them battle. Our position was on the
Lacy farm, until ten o'clock, when we moved to Parker's
store and formed line of battle, our regiment and
the Bucktails being on the extreme left.</p>

<p>John W. Urban in his "Battlefield and Prison pen"
says, "Capt. Wasson of Co. D, was ordered to take
his company and move through the woods beyond for
the purpose of reconnoitering the enemy's lines." This
is an error. The party was made up of a special detail
of twenty men, two from each company in the regiment.
Captains Minnigh and Wasson were in charge,
and the actual mission was entirely unknown to Capt.
Wasson, who was ordered to take charge of the men
and assist Capt. Minnigh, in the duty which had been
secretly communicated to him. Wasson, nor any of the
men knew what was to be done. Fortunately, I have
in my possession the order, delivered to me, at Division
Head-quarters, on said occasion. This order reads
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain, You will proceed, at once, to the front
bearing slightly to the left, to the Plank-road, and
(if possible,) find out what troops are moving on it &amp;
in which direction they are moving."</p>

<p>It was intimated at the same time, that the mission
was of a <i>peculiar</i> character, and that Capt. Wasson
would obey my orders.</p>

<p>Comrade Urban's description of our advance, is in
the main correct, but when we found the enemy before
us, I asked Capt. Wasson to withdraw a few paces into
the woods through which we had advanced, then and
there informing him of the orders placed in my hands.
He began at once to put on airs, (a habit of his,) and
positively refused to obey my orders. He advanced
the detail out into an open field, when one single shot
stampeded the party, and they returned to our line,
with the enemy on their heels.</p>

<p>I abandoned the detail hastily, and moving toward
the left parallel with the Plank-road, soon discovered
the enemy on that road, moving toward the extreme
right of the position occupied by the Union army,
which movement culminated in the attack on the outpost
position occupied by the Penn'a reserves, and
upon the Sixth corps later on.</p>

<p>Having accomplished my mission, I had no trouble
in getting back to our line, and reported to Head-quarters,
when the advance at the Parker house had
been forced back to the main line, and when the Seventh
Reserves had been captured. My impression has
always been, that if Capt. Wasson had heeded my advice,
the enemy would not have made the advance on
our front at Parker's, and the Seventh regiment would
not have been taken prisoners. I do not fear to speak
upon this point, as the question has been considerably
agitated, as to what led to the capture referred to.</p>

<p>If Co. D, was sent out on a reconnisance, as stated
by Urban, I am unacquainted with the fact.</p>

<p>Urban also says, that subsequently, "Lieut. Wilder,
(we presume he means Weidler,) and ten men were
sent on a reconnoisance in the same direction, and encountered
the enemy, and after being driven back,
Companies C and K were sent to dislodge them; but
finding the enemy in strong force, fell back in haste to
our lines."</p>

<p>It is not our object to contradict this last quotation,
but it does seem to us, that this jumble of details from
one single regiment, out of a whole division, needs an
explanation at least.</p>

<p>A single proof of the correctness of the statement I
have here made, is this:&mdash;Gen'l Crawford was much
surprised when I reported to him, all begrimmed with
dirt and smoke, having passed through the burning
woods on my return to our line. Having reported, he
said, "We never expected to see you again, ...
but, your service shall be duly reported to the Secretary
of war." This may account for the peculiar wordding
of the Commission as Brevet-Major, now in my
possession, which reads as follows:&mdash;"<i>for gallant and
meritorious services in the Wilderness campaign,
Virginia, May 5,. 1864</i>." Here we leave this subject.</p>

<p>Safely back to the Lacy farm we rested for the night,
waiting anxiously for the dawning of another day, that
the terrible conflict might be continued.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 6th, the rebel forces
were concentrated against Hancock on the left, where
a terrible battle raged nearly all day. Such a continuous
roar of musketry, inasmuch as artillery could not
be used, we never heard in all our experience before.</p>

<p>During the heavy fighting on the left, we became
engaged with the enemy in our front, driving them
back, and in the evening started to the aid Hancock,
but not being needed we returned to our old position.</p>

<p>Under cover of the night, Lee rapidly moved a
heavy column forward, and hurled them on our extreme
right. Our division was ordered to the support of
Sedgwick, whose communication had been severed
from the main army. In the darkness we felt our way
cautiously, but our services were not needed, as the
Sixth corps had stopped the advance of the enemy, so
we returned to our former position.</p>

<p>And now one of the peculiar movements, from the
right to the left flank commenced, preserving all the
while an unbroken front.</p>

<p>We moved slowly during the night of the 6th, but as
the new day dawned we moved faster, and by nine or
ten o'clock it was a double-quick. It was said to have
been a race between Grant and Lee for position at
Spottsylvania Court House, and Lee won the race, securing
the position, having had the inside track.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
Spottsylvania.</h3>


<p>The cavalry struck the rebel column, and
skirmished until the advance troops (5th corps)
arrived, and took their place.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that our division was brought
into line, owing to the shattered condition of our ranks,
caused by the double-quick, but a critical moment had
arrived, and with a cheer the men dashed forward,
re-taking the ground lost by Robinson's division. But
in the charge, as usual, we advanced too far, and were
in danger of being flanked, so we were ordered back
to our line, where we lay on our arms till six o'clock.</p>

<p>The whole army had now arrived, and the order
war given to advance. The enemy yielded, and the
first line of entrenchments was carried, and they fell
back to a strongly fortified position, from which they
could not be driven. Soon after our brigade made a
dash upon the enemy in our front, (unauthorized, it is
said,) but there being no co-operation by other troops,
we skerried back again, Col. Talley commanding the
brigade, and several hundred men having been taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>At 8 a. m. on the 9th, we moved to the right-centre
of the line, and were ordered to throw up Rifle-pits,
which Pensyl, in the emphatic language he generally
used, said, were "d&mdash;d beautiful works for somebody-else
to fight behind." George uttered truthful words,
if they were a little profane, for, while we built many
defensive works of various kinds, I do not remember
that we ever actually fought in such works.</p>

<p>Skirmishing, with an occasional undecisive struggle
for the mastery, now continued for several days, during
which we were called upon to charge on certain works
in our front, but owing to the fact that every man understood
that the charge was ordered as a mere feint
to cover some other movement, it was not pressed.</p>

<p>On the 18th, we swung round to the left, and were
sent forward on the skirmish line. Just in our front,
possibly fifty yards off, the rebel skirmishers occupied
an excellent line of rifle-pits, while we had no cover
except that afforded by nature. An order was given to
advance the line, which order was intended for other
points on the line and not for us it seems, when John
W. Shipley in the attempt to obey orders, was struck
by a rebel ball, and was instantly killed. We had the
satisfaction of knowing a moment later, that the same
rebel was killed by Shipley's especial friend Geo. W.
Pensyl. We burried Shipley near where he fell.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
North Anna river.</h3>


<p>Gen. Lee withdrew his forces to a strong position
south of the North Anna river, and Gen'l
Grant followed with the Union army in quick
pursuit. We reached the river and crossed at Jericho
ford on the 23rd, and spent three days in reconnoitering
the position of the enemy, and then by a flank
movement to the left, compelled Lee to abandon the
strong position he had taken.</p>

<p>The Union array crossed the Pamunky river on the
28th of May, the Fifth and Ninth corps crossing at
Hanover Ferry, thus bringing us once more near the
locality where the terrible scenes of 1862 were enacted.
Communications were opened with White-house Landing,
and a new base of supplies thus secured.</p>

<p>Our Brigade on the 30th of May was sent out on the
Mechanicsville road, near Bethesda church, to prevent
a possible surprise by the enemy from that direction.
Having advanced a short distance we were formed in
brigade front and ordered to throw up a barricade.
Company K. soon did the work that fell to their lot,
and every man soon was seeking to get what rest he
could, under the shade of a convenient hedge fence.</p>

<p>We were aroused by the sharp rattle of musketry on
both flanks of the brigade, and discovered further, that
the position had been abandoned, while we were sleeping,
(an unheard-of thing, but easily explained,) and
we were seemingly, alone on the line of breast-works.
Quickly arousing the men, each hurriedly took in the
situation, then, such skedadling to the rear was never
seen before, "every man for himself, and the de'il take
the hindmost." All soon were gone except five. H. C.
Elden, Cal. Harbaugh, A. H. Blocher, G. W. Pensyl
and Capt. Minnigh, the three last named running the
risk of capture, in their efforts to induce Harbaugh and
Elden to run the gauntlet as their comrades had done.
This they refused to do, saying "I'll not do it; and be
shot down like a dog." The situation was of course an
awful one, for the rebels were now in our works on both
flanks, and the race for liberty must necessarily be in
the range of every rebel musket. Turning to Pensyl,
as the two men threw themselves on the ground, thus
deciding the question, I said, "Now let us skip out."
Geo. W. do you remember that foot-race? Hey? Do
you mind the fence, all grown up with red briars, the
"durned old haversack" filled with potatoes, that you
wanted to get rid of, and could'nt? Well, we all got
out safe, while Harbaugh and Elden were transferred
to an awful southern prison.</p>

<p>The Brigade now took up a new position, threw up
a barricade, and awaited the advance of the enemy,
who soon was seen, in a well dressed line of battle,
emerging from the cover of the woods, two-hundred
yards to the front. Orders were given not to fire one
shot until the enemy reached the line of an old fence
half-way across the open space between us. We never
saw so deliberate an advance by the enemy, in all our
three years experience, as this was. Brave specimen of
American soldiery they were, consciously facing death,
they came on. Two sections of a divided battery, one
on the right the other on the left, with enfilading fire,
opened on them, then the infantry added their missiles
of destruction; they come no further, a few turn and
flee to the cover of the woods, the firing ceases and an
advance is ordered, when the only enemy we find are
the torn and shapeless forms, that literally cover the
ground, they were "annihilated." (Rebel records.)</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
Homeward bound.</h3>


<p>Hurrah! For home. This was the glad
greeting, on the morning of June 1st, when the
order was issued for our return northward.</p>

<p>We accordingly bade farewell to the Army of the
Potomac, and to the comrades of the company who
had veteranized, who were now assigned to the 190th
Penn'a Veteran Volunteers, to serve their unexpired
term of service.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June, we reached White house landing,
and went aboard the transport George Weems at
10 a. m. on the 3rd, and at 12 m. with three hearty
cheers, started northward, and landed at Washington,
D. C. on the 4th, at 4 o'clock p. m.</p>

<p>On Sunday 5th at 11:30 a. m. we left the National
Capitol, and on the 6th arrived at Harrisburg, Pa. the
Capitol of our native State.</p>

<p>We were the recipients of a Royal welcome when
we disembarked at Harrisburg, but the joyous greeting
can only be measured by the deep sorrow of many who
received not back their loved ones.</p>

<p>Three years before we as a Division of State troops,
had gone forth fully 15.000 strong, and now we were
merely a hand-full, then, full of life and buoyancy,
now, war-worn and battle-scarred veterans.</p>

<p>We proceeded to Philadelphia, and were finally
mustered out of the service, on the 13th of June 1864.</p>

<p>Company K. as a body returned to our native town
(Gettysburg,) where a Banquet welcome, had been prepared
for us, but owing to the fact that it was deferred
untill evening, only a few remained to partake of the
bounteous banquet, preferring the more humble spread
that awaited them, in the homes where loved ones surrounded
the board.</p>

<p>Of the 110 who had gone forth, three years before,
only 24 now returned.</p>

<p>Some sleep peacefully in the unmarked graves of the
south-land; no tender hand wreaths flowers over these
unknown graves, but the gentle zephyrs chant requiems
continually, and around them the wild flowers bloom
more beautiful and fragrant, because the soil was enriched
by their blood. Others after a manly struggle
for life, yielded to disability from wounds and disease.</p>

<p>We cherish the memory of our fallen comrades, and
as one by one we are summoned to join the great majority,
we hope to meet them again, and to stand side
by side, in nobler array, with the brave and true and
tried who were our comrades here, and who so well
performed their work on the battle-fields of this life.</p>

<p>And when the trumpet shall be heard, not calling
to fields of conflict, but to rewards for deeds well done,
may we all be found sharing the victory won by Him,
"who died that we might live."</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h3>


<p>While it is somewhat of a delicate matter, to write
up this Historical Record of individuals, yet we think
it should be a part of the purpose intended by this
volume. We take up the membership of the company,
according to rank: First, the Commissioned Officers,
in the order of seniority; Second, the non-Commissioned
officers, as found on the rolls at date of muster
out; Third, the members of the company in alphabetical
order.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>HISTORICAL RECORD.</h3>

<p class="p2"><b><i>Captain Edward McPherson.</i></b></p>

<p>To Captain McPherson, presumably, belongs the
credit of organizing Company K. He served as its commander
until August 24th, 1861, when he resigned, to
take his seat in the First Session of the Thirty-seventh
Congress, which convened at Washington, on the 4th
of July 1861. On the adjournment of that body, he
reported for duty, as a Volunteer aid on the staff of
Gen'l McCall, commanding the Penn'a Reserves, and
served as such until November, when the Second session
of said congress convened. While a Staff-officer,
he was a convenient intermediary, between the Division
and the Executive department at Washington, to
which he had ready access by reason of his representative
capacity.</p>

<p>Being Inspector general on the staff, he visited each
Regiment and Battery of the command, and reported
its condition as to organization, health, arms and efficiency,
which report was transmitted regularly each
week, to army Head-quarters. During his term as congressman
he was a member of the committe on military
affairs. He was Clerk of the House of Representatives,
after his term as a member expired, and is now
serving in that capacity. His residence, when at
home, is Gettysburg, Pa.</p>


<p class="p2"><b><i>Captain J. Findley Bailey.</i></b></p>

<p>At the organization of the company Capt. Bailey
was made 1st Lieutenant, and succeeded McPherson,
to the Captaincy, to date September 1st 1861.</p>

<p>Bailey was a born soldier, a strict disciplinarian, at
all times seemingly stern, yet easily approached, and
much beloved by every one.</p>

<p>At the battle of Charles city cross roads, June 30th
1862, he led the company in a general charge against
the enemy. When last seen he was pressing forward in
pursuit of fleeing foe, and when the recall was sounded,
Capt. Bailey did not return, and from that hour to
the present he has never been heard of. What his fate
was, we dare scarcely permit ourselves even to guess.
But if he fell, it was facing the foe, and doing noble
service, and dying a soldiers glorious death.</p>


<p class="p2"><b><i>Captain W. Warren Stewart.</i></b></p>

<p>Captain Stewart was made Orderly Sergeant of
the company at its organization, and served as such
until the promotion attending the resignation of McPherson
took place, when he was chosen 1st Lieutenant,
to date September 3rd 1861. Soon afterward he
was appointed Adjutant of the Regiment, and served
as such until June 30th 1862, when he was severely
wounded, and was finally sent to the Gen'l Hospital,
at David's Island, N. Y. where he remained until the
early part of October following, when he returned to
the company encamped at Sharpsburg, Md. During
his absence from the company he was promoted to the
Captaincy, vice Bailey, who was reported killed, and
mustered to date June 30th 1862. He now remained
in command of the company until the general promotion
took place in the early part of 1863, when he was
commissioned Lieut. Colonel, to date March 7th 1863.</p>

<p>Stewart had a firm hold upon the hearts and affections
of the whole regiment, and as he served in a regimental
capacity most of the time, he was popular in
the Division. While he was qualified to command, he
possessed, at the same time, excellent clerical and executive
ability. He was mustered out with the regiment,
June 13. 1864, and soon after was appointed
Colonel, and had command of the 212th Regiment,
Penn'a Volunteers, which position he held to the close
of the war. Professionally, he is a civil engineer, and
finds constant employment in that vocation.</p>

<p>His residence and P. O. address is York Springs, Pa.</p>


<p class="p2"><b><i>Captain Henry N. Minnigh.</i></b></p>

<p>Capt. Minnigh recorded his name on the register
of the company only a few hours before it left Gettysburg,
and therefore had no part in the "getting up" of
Co. K, having enlisted as "a high private in the rear
rank." When the company was fully organized at
Camp Wayne, he was appointed Fourth Serg't, and
at Camp Tennally, September 3. 1861, he was promoted
to Orderly Sergeant, by Col. R. Biddle Roberts,
and held the position till after the Peninsula campaign.</p>

<p>He was promoted to 2nd Lieut. and was mustered
as such, to date June 30. 1862. Immediately after his
promotion, he was ordered to report to the officer in
charge of the Division ambulance corps, for duty with
said corps, but by special request he was excused from
that duty, and he remained with the company.</p>

<p>Frequently, was it made the especial work of Capt.
Minnigh, to be sent out on a scouting expedition, or
a reconnoisance with a detail of picked men, and he
can recount some daring and dangerous adventures,
through which he passed while performing such duty.</p>

<p>At the battle of South mountain September 14. '62,
he was wounded by a minnie ball, through the left arm
near the shoulder, at the same instant that Lieut. Sadler
was killed, thus leaving the company without a
commissioned officer. He was absent from the command,
just three weeks.</p>

<p>On March 7. 1863, he was promoted to 1st Lieut.
and on October 27. to Captain, both commissions are
however dated March 7.</p>

<p>In reference to Capt. Minnigh's character as a soldier
and a commanding officer, we quote from manuscripts
in our possession. Rob't T. McKinney says,
"I can never forget the Captain's kindness of heart.
when in the service. Doubtless, he will remember how,
when on the march, he used to come from the right of
the company to the left where I was, and kindly, ask
how I was pulling through, then seeing my feeble condition,
he demanded my arms and equipments, and
also the knapsack, strapped them on his own tired
body, and then ordering me to march outside of the
ranks, took his place in the company, and carred my
burdens through a weary march for 48 hours."</p>

<p>Wm. T. Jobe says, "As a soldier, Capt. Minnigh's
record is an enviable one, he led the company with
gallantry and spirit on all occasions, securing the commendations
of his superior officers, for bravery and
good behavior, under trying circumstances."</p>

<p>He is the possessor of a commission as Brev.-Major,
signed by the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Having been mustered out with the company, June
13. 1864, he prceeded to Washington, and accepted a
clerkship in the War department, where he served till
August 9. 1866, when he returned to his native county
and engaged in teaching.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1871, he entered the ministry of the
Methodist Episcopal church, and has been laboring
successfully in the Itinerancy since that time.</p>


<p class="p2"><b><i>Lieut. J. Durbin Sadler.</i></b></p>

<p>Lieutenant Sadler at the organization of the company
was appointed First Corporal. August 22. he was
chosen 2nd Lieut. vice Herron resigned, and served as
such until September 30. 1862, when he was appointed
1st Lieut. to succeed Stewart promoted.</p>

<p>It is sad to record the sacrifice of one who lived so
noble a life, for when Lieut. Sadler fell, the company
we think, lost its best commanding officer. Sadler was
killed by a minnie ball, in the battle of South mountain
September 14. 1862, while gallantly leading the
command in the final charge, which drove the enemy
from the summit and gave the victory to our forces.</p>

<p>His body was removed to his home at York springs,
Pa. and was buried with the honors of war, under the
charge of Lieut. Minnigh, who in his wounded state accompanied
his remains and laid them to rest.</p>

<p>He sleeps peacefully by the side of his ancestors, in
the beautiful cemetery at Hampden, Pa. awaiting a
glorious resurrection, which his pure and spotless life
and character warrants. May we meet him again on
the peaceful shore, beyond life's troubled river.</p>

<p>He was mustered out with the company, June 13th
1864, returned to his home at Gettysburg and there
followed the business of Granite cutting for several
years. He died on the 12th day of March 1874.</p>

was placed, and as an Orderly he was a treasure. The
books were neatly kept and always at hand, as he had
a habit of carrying those most needed in his knapsack.</p>

by the accidental discharge of his musket. For some

<p class="large center">WHO STOLE THE DUMPLINGS?</p>

<p>At Fairfax Station, Lieut's Minnigh and Kitzmiller
having secured some very fine apples, and a
batch of real wheat flour, concluded to have an Apple-dumpling
dinner. A Camp-kettle was brought into
requisition, the dumplings were made by "Cornelius",
who took charge of the preparation, and soon the kettle
was steaming over a blazing fire.</p>

<p>A few guests were invited, the board was well spread
and all waited anxiously, the summons to the feast, for
'Nelius had said, "Dey's most biled, Boss." Suddenly
while thus waiting, Cornelius at one bound sprung into
the tent and blurted out these words, "deed and double,
dey's gone, sure 'nuff; somebody's done gone and
stole de dump-l-i-n-e-s, kittle and all!"</p>

<p>This proved to be an actual fact, and to this day the
real thief, who stole everything but these officer's
tremendous appetite for dumplings, has never been
discovered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center large">NO TWO SHOTS,<br />
EVER STRIKE THE SAME SPOT?</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="100" height="145" alt="An" />incident at Spottsylvania, will
easily be recalled to memory. In
some movement, in which our regiment
participated, our flank was
brought in range with a rebel battery,
when a 20 pound shot came
whizzing along. Fortunately, it
was poorly aimed, and exploded as it struck the ground.</p>

<p>The shell tore a hole in the ground, about ten feet
from our line, immediately in front of our company,
sufficiently deep to bury a team of mules. Several of
the boys said, "No two shots, ever strike the same
spot," as they jumped into the cavity, considering it a
safe place. Scarcely had they entered it however, until
another shot from the same gun, came rico-cheting in
the track of the former, struck the ground and tore its
way right through under them. The shell did not explode,
fortunately, and no one was hurt, but such a
"scrabbling out" of that hole, and scratching of dirt
out of eyes and ears, was rediculously amusing.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>


<p class="center large">TWO FRIENDS PART FOREVER.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i017.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="It" />was amusing to listen to Bill
Mumper express himself under the
excitement of Battle, when somehow,
though brave as a lion, he
lost control of himself.</p>

<p>At North Anna river, after we
had crossed at Jericho fording,
we lay in an open field, and the artillery were throwing
shot and shell, to and fro, over our heads. One of the
shells exploded prematurely right above us, and a portion
coming straight down, struck Mumper's tin-cup
buckled to his haversack, which was slung over his
shoulder, smashing it into a shapeless mass. Bill got
mad, and in his anger uttered words, something like
these, "Make out a requisition for a new tin-cup, quick;
d&mdash;&mdash;d if that was'nt the last tin in the brigade;" then
taking the relic in his hand, he soliloquized as follows.</p>

<p>"Good bye! old tin-cup, Good bye! You've been a
faithful friend to me, ... I have'nt time to shed any
tears just now, but I'll miss you like &mdash;&mdash;, and I'll
often think of&mdash;" Just then a shell exploded right in
our midst, and springing to his feet, as the order, attention!
was given, he exclaimed finally, "H&mdash;&mdash; they
won't let me alone in my sorrow!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="center large">AN AWFUL DEATH.</p>

<p>At Charles' City cross roads, when lying down
under the heavy cannonry, a solid shot struck a
tree, twenty feet from the ground, cutting it off clean
from the main trunk. It then dropped to the ground
in an upright position, and in doing so, struck the prostrate

<p class="center large">"SNAP" IN A PIG-PEN</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i019.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="On" />
the march toward Washington,
after the Second Bull-Run,
'Snap' Rouzer got tired out, and
concluded to take a rest. Finding
a convenient pig-pen by the road-side,
he crawled in, and soon was
asleep. When he awoke from his
slumbers, the troops were still going
by, but he resolved, first, to take a look at outside
surroundings. When he did so, he discovered that our
troops had disappeared, and the Johnnies were going
by with long and hurried steps, so he laid low for two
mortal hours watching and counting the rebels passing.</p>

<p>When the way was clear, he lit out, by a flank
movement and rejoined the company, first reporting
to Division Head-quarters, the numbers of the enemy
he had seen in pursuit of our forces. He said that a
commission was promised him for the valuable information,
but the commission never came to hand.</p>

<p>Rouzer frequently was absent from the command, a
day or two at a time, and when interrogated as to the
matter, would merely say that he had been on a scout.</p>

<p>We must here relate, one of Rouzer's pranks.
An order had been issued, from Head-quarters,
requiring all soldiers to remain with the Camps of
the various regiment, as many were accustomed to
pitch their tents in a convenient woods, away from the
camp. Jim was one of those affected by the order,
but as usual, paid no attention to it, and with several
comrades remained out, "where wood and water was
plenty." When told of the order, on coming to the
main camp for rations, he simply uttered a single bad
word, gave his long black mustache a push to one side,
(you remember that mustache, one side up in the air
and the other trying to look respectable?) and then he
went back to his "dog-tent" in the woods.</p>

<p>Presently an officer was sent from Head-quarters, to
drive all stragglers into camp, and riding up to Snap's
tent, with the usual big fire in front of it, inquired of
Jim sitting composedly by the fire, why he was not in
camp according to orders. "Well, Captain! I'd like to
be there, but I'm taking care of them fellers in there,
just now," said Jim, pointing to the tent, where two
men were sleeping on a pallet of straw. "This is a
hos-pit-tal, and them poor sojers is awful bad with the
Small-pox." It is said that the officer concluded that
he had business some where else just then, and rode off
at full speed, and left Rouzer master of the situation.</p>

<p class="center large">"You can't spit in my ear."</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i109.jpg" width="100" height="157" alt="T" />he comrades will remember
the squad of new recruits, at
Camp Tennally, a few of whom
were "raw, very raw," but who
at the end of the term of service,
"were sharp as any."</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash;h was one of these, and
it is said, some the boys played
the following trick on him, when, for the first time, he
was put on guard duty. He was warned by the boys,
to be a little watchful, as they often played tricks on the
new beginners, and named some rediculous things that
had been formerly played on recruits, none of which,
had any foundation in fact. L&mdash;&mdash;h had no idea that
the boys were putting up a job on him, and when put
on guard, he walked his beat as proud as a gobbler in
a barn-yard, and with an air about him that said, "you
can't play any tricks on me!"</p>

<p>About sunset the officer of the camp guard made the
rounds, and gave the countersign, whispering the same
in the ear of each guard as customary. The officer approached
L&mdash;&mdash;h for this purpose, but was held back
by a movement of the bayonet, and with a knowing
grin, he exclaimed, "Oh! You can't spit in my ear."</p>

use of which, much good or much harm
may be done, but our object is to preserve
a few reminiscences, which ought
to be handed down to our children.</p>

<p>Jacobs was on guard, at Regimental Head-quarters
on one occasion, and as was often the case when the
relief seemed to be behind time, he called out two or
three times, very distinctly, "Two o'clock, and no relief."
This annoyed Col. Roberts who was awaked in
the midst of his slumbers, so when the sentinel again
yelled, "Two o'clock, and no-o-o-o&mdash;" he never finished,
for two distinct shots of a revolver, in the Col's
tent attracted his attention, and approaching the same
he hurriedly inquired "Colonel, Colonel! any thing the
matter, in there?" The reply was, "I did'nt hit you,
did'nt I? Now you holler again, d&mdash;&mdash;you, and I'll
blow out your brains." Jacobs did'nt holler any more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>Having been detailed for duty, with the Pioneer
Corps, he reported at once to Head-quarters, and
when they asked his name and regiment, replied "Co.
K., of the First, and my name is John Henry Kelley
Jacobs." The Captain looked at him inquiringly, and
said, "I want only your name, not all the names in the
regiment." That was, however, his real name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i017.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="It" /> is related that on the march,
through Maryland, Rouzer came
straggling into camp and reported
to the boys, that he had discovered
an Ice-house well filled, and
not a great ways off. A party of
half a dozen, soon were on the
way piloted by Jim. Presently,
they came to the house, mostly under ground, by the
side of a pond of water. The door being locked a few
lusty blows knocked it off the hinges, and sure enough,
it was well filled, and covered nicely, with a layer of
straw. Well, several of the boys jumped in at the same
instant, when, Lo! what seemed to be a body of Ice,
was water, with a mass of floating straw on top, and
the boys were plunging and snorting in six feet of ice-cold,
filthy drainage. They charged Snap with a put-up
job, and&mdash;well, maybe it was.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Orderly Young says, that after returning to our
camp from the Burnside "stick in the mud," he was
ready for almost anything, and that night he and
John Brandon played their first game of cards.</p>

<p>By the way, Sammy, where did you play the final
game, Hey?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center large">WHO KILLED THAT CALF?</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i112.jpg" width="100" height="143" alt="In" /> a foraging Expedition, two
members of the company found a
fatted calf, in a farmers barn-yard,
and soon the greater portion of it
was transferred to their haversacks,
and they rejoined the command
just in time for the evening
Dress-parade.</p>

<p>They kept very quiet about the matter, and no one
suspected what was about to happen. The parade was
formed the foragers were in the rear rank. After the
usual manual of arms, the Colonel gave the command,
"Rear rank, open order, March!" this movement being
gracefully performed, the Colonel went to the head
of the regiment, and accompanied by a citizen, they
passed down the line, the farmer scanning the face of
every soldier in the front rank; having reached the
left of the line, they turned and gave the same attention
to the rear rank. Just then, a movement took
place in Co. K., two men quickly exchanged places
in the rear rank with two others in the front rank, no
one outside of the company, it seems, noticing the
movement.</p>

<p>The sequel, to the whole proceeding was this. That
lank looking farmer had followed the men into camp,
and having reported to Colonel Roberts, he was told,
that if he could point out the two men, he would have
them punished; hence the inspection that took place.</p>

<p>Well, he did'nt find the men, but still he said that
they belonged to the First regiment. Of course they
did, but they outwited the farmer.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="100" height="145" alt="An" /> appetite for smoked meat, was
omnipresent among the men, and
all the "salt horse and sow-belly"
in the commissary, could not satisfy
that appetite.</p>

<p>At Bristow station, it was necessary
to make a special trip to army
Head-quarters on the Rapidan, for a supply, but our
"little dutchman" took another plan. Going down the
rail-road to the next station, he jumped an open car
loaded with barrels of ham, (he called it shunka-fliesh,)
and as the train neared our camp, he tumbled a barrel
off, into a clump of bushes by the road-side. Then
quietly, assisted by others, it was brought into camp.</p>

<p>That was good ham, as we have reason to know, a
fine slice having somehow found its way to our table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="center large">McCABE'S BIG KNAPSACK.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i024.jpg" width="100" height="140" alt="C" />aptain Minnigh at Spottsylvania,
was placed in charge of some
men, with orders to find the ammunition
train, and get a supply
of cartridges for the regiment.</p>

<p>The train was soon found, and
at no great distance from the command,
but the direct intervening space, was open
ground and covered by a rebel battery; this necessitated
a long detour, in order to reach the regiment in
safety. One of the detailed men was McCabe of Co. D,
(I think,) a noble and good-hearted specimen of an
Irish soldier, and a man who always carried a mule's
load in his knapsack; when therefore, each man had
shouldered a box of cartridges and started, McCabe
turned to the Captain, and said, "Faith and be-jabers
Cap'n, an' oi'm goin' shtraight over to the rigament."
Suiting his action to the words, he was gone.</p>

<p>All went well till he reached the middle of the open
space, when the boom of a single gun was heard, and a
hissing shell came down the ravine as if it was hunting
for the Irishman. He looked around for an instant,
then turned just in time to let the shell strike squarely,
the well packed knapsack. It knocked him down, his
cap going one way and the box of cartridges the other
way; to our surprise he scrabbled up, picked up his cap
and deliberately put it on his head, then shouldered
the ammunition box, and started again. The fact is,
he was not hurt in the least degree. That tremendous
knapsack saved his life.</p>

sight on one occasion, as
we awoke from the slumber
of the night. It was a bivouac,
and snow had fallen

snow, we thought of the great resurrection morning.</p>

and many rebel prisoners taken,
when an order was given to take
no more prisoners, but to disarm
them and let them go. After a
certain charge, Orderly sergeant
Minnigh when the recall was sounded, met M. M. Miller
returning to our line with two prisoners.</p>

<p>He called Miller's attention to the orders, and said
he should smash the muskets around a tree and let the
prisoners go. Mike proceeded to do this, but the fellow
resisted and there was quite a scuffle. Sergeant M.
watched the contest for a moment, but just then he noticed
a movement on the part of the other Johnnie,
and saw him in the act of levelling a revolver at Miller.
Quick action was necessary, and with a spring
and a yell he struck the arm of the rebel, with his
clubbed musket, sending the pistol into the air, and
breaking the arm midway between the elbow and
the wrist. Minnigh picked up the revolver and sent it
home afterward as a relic. Miller took the muskets,
and destroyed them, letting the prisoners go.</p>

to the front at a certain pay-day,
put up his Tent without opposition
from the authorities, and
opened a "gambling hell," and a
number of the boys were beaten
out of their hard earnd money by
the wily rascal. Doc was lured into the den, and lost
every cent he had in a very few games. He then took
a favorable position and watched the gambler closely,
and soon discovered the secret of his success, and concluded
to beat him at his own game. But how? his
money was gone. He approached one of his most intimate
friends, (every member of of the company was
his friend,) and solicited the loan of $10, candidly revealing
the facts, as stated above, asserting in addition,
the positive assurance of retrieving his former losses.</p>

<p>At this moment another comrade came in and heard
the concluding words, and at his suggestion, each gave
Doc $5.00, and having received the cash, he seemed
very grateful, then turning to go he said, "I'll pay you
back your money to-night."</p>

<p>In about two hours, he returned to camp, paid back
the borrowed money, promptly, and held in his hand
quite a roll of green-backs besides. When asked the
question, "How did you do it?" he answered with a

<p>Many of Company K. had like experiences, if they
cared to relate them.</p>

<p>"I was with the company on the march to Gettysburg,"
says comrade Durboraw, "and it was amusing
as familliar scenes, persons and faces were presented to
our view. Some young ladies whom I recognized, as
we passed along, not far from my home, and who were
waving their handkerchiefs at the soldiers passing by,
gazed at me in amazement as I named them, and as
they did not recognize me, inquired, one of another,
who that could be that knew them. When we arrived at
the home of Serg't Young his own brother Robert came
to us, but the Sergeant did not leave the ranks.</p>

<p>While in bivouac, in J. M. Diehl's field, where we
halted just before noon on July 2, to get a little rest,
and wait for orders, Robison came to me when cooking
my coffee, and told me that Peter Baker, living
near by, wished to see me, so I went to his house, and
after getting something to eat, returned promptly to
the company. Just when I reached the command the
orders were given to fall-in double-quick, and hurriedly
we advanced to the Round-tops, obliquing into
position left in front, ... fired two rounds,
when the order 'Forward!' was given, and every man
had to hunt his way as best he could, over, round and
through the bushes, rocks, stones and Plum-run swamp
in the flat below. How the rebels, who were in numbers
right in our front as the order to charge was given,
it is hard to tell, but most of them did; when we got
to the wheat-field the line was halted, and finaly established
at the stone fence, which is in place today.</p>

<p>I now told Capt. Minnigh I was going home, and
that he should neither say, Yes or No! I went back to
the place where we had piled our knapsacks, the day
before, but could find neither knapsack nor Creamer
the guard, but looking round I eventually found it in
a quarry on the banks of Rock-creek. I had only three
miles home and soon reached it, only to find it filled
with wounded soldiers, Gen'l Meredith being one of
the number. I slept on the floor that night, and the
next morning, with a knapsack well filled, I returned
to the company. I did not find many of the people in
the neighborhood at their homes, and their houses were
occupied by skulkers and shuysters absent from their
commands. When I got back to the company I shared
out the contents of my haversack, and when we marched
that night it was empty.</p>

<p>On the march that night I passed through a house
by the road-side, and met a number of my relatives,
but only said, How d'ye do, and Good bye, and was
off again."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center large">"Green Persimmon Pies."</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i024.jpg" width="100" height="140" alt="C" />heated, by gosh! was the
exclamation of a certain comrade
in an undertone, as he spat out a
huge mouthful of fresh baked pie.</p>

<p>Well! the explanation is just as
follows; two pies had been secured
on the march that day from a colored
woman, at twenty five cents each, but when the
soldier came to sample the pies, he found they were
made of green persimmons, and the lower crust was
corn-meal. No wonder he tried to use "cuss words,"
his mouth being ready either to swear or to whistle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p class="center large">Thirty-two rebels Captured on the Picket-line.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="100" height="145" alt="An" /> incident at Spottsylvania may
be related here. The Picket line
had been driven in, and a detail
of forty men, was placed in charge
of Captain Minnigh who was merely
instructed to re-establish that
line, which he was told curved in,
bringing the rebel pickets near to
our Division Head-quarters. The only portion of our
line visible was on the extreme right, at a white house
on an elevation of ground. He at once proceeded a
short distance to the left, and soon reached Burnside's
unbroken line, on its extreme right and at the point
where that line was broken off abruptly. From this
point to the house referred to, was a distance of half
a mile, and this space was to be occupied by the new
line. "That woods is full of rebels, and you and your
men will be captured if you go in there," was an officers
greeting when told of the work assigned to the
detail, "It will take a brigade to re-establish the line."</p>

<p>Not the least dismayed, the word of command was
given and the advance into the woods was started, in
a bee-line for the white house, a glimpse of which was
occasionally seen through the trees.</p>

<p>By stationing a picket every twenty five yards, the
space could be covered, and this was done, without the
least molestation on the part of the enemy, not a rebel
being visible. Scarcely was the line re-established,
when one of the movements peculiar to this campaign
commenced, and an order came instructing the picket
line to fall back, preserving an unbroken line. This
was done, and when the movement was completed we
counted thirty-two rebel pickets captured on the line.</p>

<p>This question remains to be answered. How did the
new line of union pickets cut the rebel line in two places,
as evidently it did, without seeing an enemy or
firing a shot?</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i019.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="On" />ly for the Soldiers, none
for officers," were the words that
met Sergeant M&mdash;&mdash;as he took
a cup of water out of a bucket, at
a yard-gate, in the neat village of
Drainsville while the Pa. Reserves
were passing through on a reconnoisance.</p>

<p>An aged lady and two young girls stood by the vessel
of water, and one of the girls had spoken the words
quoted above. The Sergeant was about to drink from
the well filled cup, when Gen'l Reynolds riding up to
the gate, said to him, "Sergeant! get me a cup of that
water." He promptly handed the cup, still untouched,
to the General, who drank the water, expressed his
thanks and rode away. Deprived of his drink he now
turned to get another cup for himself, but was met by a
blunt refusal from one of the girls, who said, "You
gave your cup of water to that officer, and you cannot
have any more." His reply to this was, "I'll give my
Brigade commander a cup of water every time, even if
it deprives me of a drink, at the hands of a she rebel."</p>

<p>As he finished this direct language she turned quickly
and 'spit' in his face, not once but twice. M&mdash;&mdash;
turned and walked away, but took along the bucket
of water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>Who were the boys, that took a Piano from the
mansion near Camp Pierpont, and hid it in the barn
among the fodder, previous to its shipment north, at
the close of the war? As the war unexpectedly continued
for four years afterward it must have been considerably
out of tune.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center large">"THAT'S THE VERY FELLOW!"</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i109.jpg" width="100" height="157" alt="T" />he Army of the Potomac, in
one of the advances southward,
crossed the Potomac at the Berlin
ferry, and pushed down through
Loudoun valley. The Captain
was sick during part of this advance,
and we give a strange coincidence
which then had its origin,
in his own words.</p>

<p>After crossing on the Pontoon bridge I was put into
an ambulance, and after proceeding a mile or two, I
gave my place in the ambulance to a poor fellow who
had sun-stroke, and who seemed more dead than alive.
I plodded on as best I could, being some distance in
the rear of my command, when Gen'l&mdash;&mdash;followed by
his staff came riding along. He addressed me sharply,
inquiring why I was away from my command. I told
him of my illness and how I had given my place in the
ambulance to the soldier, then, with a contemptible
toss of the head he muttered, "A likely story," and
rode on. In the evening I caught up, at the camping
ground, sick, tired and hungry; but soldiers fare was
entirely unpalatable, and I could not eat it, so I went
to the village close by, (Lovettsville,) determined to
secure something tasteful. I approached a house at
the outskirts of the town, for the flavor of newly baked
pies had been wafted toward me by the evening breeze
and I decided that a pie, a fresh blackberry-pie, was
just what would suit my case. Knocking at a side entrance
I was admitted by a young lady, who moved a
convenient rocker and bade me be seated. Presently
a middle-aged lady entered the room, bearing two
pies, which were added to a number already on the
large dining table opened to its full capacity. Taking
courage I told the woman of my illness and my craving
for home-fare, and that in her motherly goodness
would she sell me two of those pies? She replied,
that she would like to do so, but that General&mdash;&mdash;
(the same officer I had met on the march that day,)
had ordered the pies, for himself and his staff officers.</p>

<p>With this she left the room, and then I appealed to
the young lady who seemed to be on my side, but she
stated her inability to reverse the decision made by
her aunt, but added these words as she pointed to the
table, "If I want a pie I take it." That settled the
matter, and I went to the table, put two pies together,
and with an ordinary stride started for camp, convinced
that the two pies were not baked for Gen'l&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I got to camp all right, and enjoyed the pies exceedingly,
and the whole circumstance was soon forgotten,
and perhaps never would have been recalled had
not the following incident occurred.</p>

<p>When Company K, had been mustered out at the
expiration of the full three years term of service, we
returned home, and having closed up all the company
affairs, I finally turned toward the residence of my
father on the corner of Middle and Washington streets,
and entered the door as the bell called to supper, I
was ushered into the dining-room, and introduced by
my mother as the returned soldier boy, and was shown
to a seat at the board, where a number of persons, of
both sexes were already seated. Suddenly a young
lady, a perfect stranger to me, after staring me full in
the face for a moment, with a hearty laugh and a gleeful
clapping of her hands, addressing my mother exclaimed,
"Oh, Mrs. M., do you remember I told you
about a sick officer taking two pies from aunties dining
table, down at Lovettsville, Va?" and without waiting
for a reply, pointing her finger in my direction she added
"That's the very fellow!" This proved to be the
same young lady teaching in Gettysburg, and boarding
at my mother's table. We enjoyed that supper,
after rehearsing the story of the stolen pies, and when
supper was about finished, I got an extra piece of pie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="100" height="145" alt="An" /> interesting story! is the
general verdict rendered, where
ever I have related the incidents
connected with my visit home, on
the evening of July 3rd, when the
command was relieved from the
front, at the Round-tops.</p>

<p>As the Story may be interesting to others, I will relate
it for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>When we went into bivouac, on the spot where the
Round-top Park dancing-floor now stands, many of
the company whose homes were in Gettysburg or the
immediate vicinity, quietly slipped away, and believing
that our work, for a while at least, was ended, I
also went, saying to the boys when I started, "Boys if
you go home, don't fail to get back to-morrow morning."
I am proud of the conduct of company K, at, as
well as after the battle of Gettysburg, and why should
I not be? These brave fellows could easily imagine the
dangerous surroundings of loved ones, during the terrible
conflict, in their homes within the bounds of the
battle-field, yet, not a man left the ranks or fled from
duty, and while most of them got home after the battle,
by a peculiar device, only one failed to return.</p>

<p>But to my story; I passed northward just in the rear
of the line of battle, and through the Citizens cemetery,
thence up Baltimore street to the Court-house on
the corner of Middle street, which was a dangerous
performance, as the whole route was exposed to rebel
sharp-shooters, making it necessary to cross all streets
and alleys at a bound. Having reached the point indicated,
I found the residence of my father, on west
Middle street one square from the Court-house, so completely
covered by rebel sharp-shooters, that it was
an impossible measure to go there.</p>

<p>I observed things closely, and saw a certain officer
who was apparetly not acquainted with the dangerous
surroundings, turn the corner where I was standing,
and walk deliberately down in the middle of the street,
without being molested, but, Alas! the poor fellow
when he got below Washington street, was taken prisoner.
So I took advantage of what I had seen, and
walked down the street, with misgivings I confess, for
doubtless many rifles were aimed at me, with a rebel
finger on each trigger, ready to send as many messengers
of death, if I should turn either to the right or to
the left. It was an awful moment, but I determined
to carry out my plan, which was to spring into a flower
garden on the east side of the house, when I would
reach that point, for I would then be in a safe place.</p>

<p>On! on, to hesitate would be fatal; and how terrible
it would be to die so near to the loved ones; still on I
went, not hurriedly, for the enemy must not even think
that I have a purpose in view; Oh! If only the yard-gate
were open! Ah, it is open! A spring, and I am
through it, and behind the cover of the house; I am
safe, but what a shower of minnie balls strike the pavement
over which I came, and how they tear through
the palings of the fence on both sides of the open gate,
terrible messengers they are, but harmless now as far
they concerned me.</p>

<p>None of the family were visible, so I entered the unlocked
door of a back kitchen, which was empty, then
into the main building I went and all through it from
main floor to attic, and found no one; disappointed
I turned to the cellar and was met on the stair-way by
a sister, who failed to recognize me in the semi-darkness,
who said, "Here! what do you want?" On the
spur of the moment I said, "Can you supply me with
just a bite to eat?" With this she retired below and I
followed to the foot of the stairs, and took a seat near
the lower step, and this is what I then saw: father and
mother, four sisters and a brother, two or three improvised
beds, an almost consumed tallow dip on the end
of a barrel in a far off corner, and each person being
a perfect image of dejection and despondency.</p>

<p>Sister Lucy whispered something to mother, who
then entered an adjoining pantry, doubtless to get the
"bite to eat," while a younger sister approached me
inquiring, "I wonder how much longer we will have
to remain in this cellar?" I merely answered, "Not
long," but I discovered that they were entirely ignorant
of the state affairs without. She looked at me
closely, and then followed mother into the pantry.</p>

<p>Presently, mother approached me, bearing a huge
piece of bread in her hand, and peering very closely
into my face, then as if in glad surprise, she ejaculated,
"Oh, you bad fellow, I know you now! Here's your
supper."</p>

<p>I will not attempt a portrayal of the scene that followed,
but in a few words I revealed the state of affairs
without, and brought them from that lower world, in
which they had dwelt several days, into the light and
comfort of the upper world once more.</p>

<p>Soon an ample supper spread the board, and then
all retired to the comfortable beds, of which they had
been deprived for two nights, and I had not enjoyed
for two years. That night the confederate army began
the evacuation of Gettysburg.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center large">Lieut. Sadler, buried at home.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i019.jpg" width="100" height="146" alt="On" /> the 14th of September 1862, at
South Mountain, in the charge up
the last acclivity, and just when
the victory was won, Lieut. J. D.
Sadler fell in death, and Lieut.
Minnigh was wounded.</p>

<p>As I wish to relate the circumstances
connected with the removal
of Sadler's body from the field where he fell, to
his home fifty-two miles away, for burial, and as I in
my wounded state, in the face of many difficulties in
the way, undertook the work of removal, I will tell the
story, in my own words.</p>

<p>I was wounded by a minnie ball, through the left
arm near the shoulder, when in the act of crossing the
stone fence at the foot of the hill, and as my arm dropped
to my side being completely paralyzed, I believed
the injury was greater than it afterward proved to be,
hence, I did not proceed any further. Having retired
to the field hospital, a surgeon grasped my wounded
arm and after a cursory examination, said, "Your arm
must be taken off," but I did not see things just in that
light, and slipped away.</p>

<p>At Middletown, four miles away, dwelt a relative of
my wife's family, Appelman by name, and Mrs. A.,
was at the same time Lieut. Sadler's aunt, so I determined
to go there. Upon reaching the village I was
informed, that Dr. Reed our Regimental surgeon, was
in charge of the Gen'l Hospital in a Church, so I went
there. He told me my arm was all right after removing
quite large piece of the bone.
</p><p>
After mid-night, I found the home above indicated,
but as no response came to my timid rapping, I waited
for the morning. At the early dawn I was admitted to
the house, got a good breakfast, had my arm dressed
and was put to bed. Presently voices were heard below
stairs, and I recognized that of Roades of our company.
Hastening below I heard the sad news of Lieut.
Sadler's death, as well as the other losses that befel
the company. We at once planned the removal of his
body by private conveyance, to York Springs, Pa., a
distance of fifty-two miles.
</p><p>
Mr. Appelman had two horses in his stable, and we
concluded to use them in the furtherance of our plans.
A hearse and driver were secured, and Sadler's body
was brought from the battle-field, en-coffined, and
all things got ready for an early start on the morning
of the Sixteenth; I determined to accompany the body
incognito, and borrowed a citizens suit accordingly.
</p><p>
On the morning of the 17th at 2 o'clock, we started
with the hearse drawn by one horse, and I mounted
on the other horse, apparently the most unsophistocated
countryman you ever saw. Let me say here, that
I had determined to accompany the body, and as it
would have been impossible to have secured a leave of
absence, the above measure was adopted, so as not to
be annoyed by the Provost guard.
</p><p>
We soon reached Frederick city and passed through
unmolested, but at a toll-gate a mile out on the Emmittsburg
pike we found the out-posts, who refused to
let us pass, but after giving satisfactory answers to all
questions, we finally were permitted to pass on. At
Creagerstown we fed our horses and took breakfast, I
also resumed the military uniform, as there was now
no necessity of a disguise. Near the town of Emmittsburg
I stopped at a residence, in the front yard of
which there was a well of water, for the purpose of bathing
my wounded arm, when a woman came rushing
out and said, no Union soldier could have any water
from that well; I answered in laughing good humor,
that I thought I knew one who would, when she took
hold of the pump handle, and tried to prevent my
pumping the water. I gently pushed her away, when
she called a dog to her assistance, and a large bloodhound
rushed around the house, and sprung at me.
</p><p>
But I was ready, and a single shot laid him low. At
this, the woman commenced to cry bitterly, and said
she would call the men; my reply was, that the men
would be dealt with in the same way. No men appeared
fortunately, and I mounted my horse and rode off.
</p><p>
At Emmittsburg we fed our horses and took dinner,
and then we were on the road again. A few miles out
on the Gettysburg road we were met by my father and
brother, who came with a conveyance to aid me on my
way. We reached Gettysburg about 4 o'clock, and
rested until after supper, and then were off again, having
still 14 miles to the end of our journey. But I was
entirely worn out, when I reached Heidlersburg. I
went into the hotel, kept by a relation of Sadler, threw
myself on a bar-room bench, and&mdash;&mdash;slept, slept so
soundly that I could not be awakened, so they carried
me to bed, and I was surprised next morning, to find
myself there and still seven miles to the journey's end.
</p><p>
After breakfast, I quickly covered this distance, and
found all arrangements made, for the funeral that day
in the afternoon. A squad of raw material, was briefly
drilled, in the manual of arms, and at 4 o'clock, we
buried "our fallen comrade" with the honors of war,
in the family burial ground, at Hampton, to await
the reveille on the morning of the resurrection day.

a proper Eulogium, of the
character of these fallen heroes.</p>

<p>They gave up the fair promise
of a useful life, gave up chances of
fame, aye! gave up life for the
Salvation of the common country.
</p><p>
In what light can I set the high mark of their patriotism?
What words can tell the story of their courage,
with what language can I adorn their lofty heroism?
</p><p>
How valiently they fought, how serenely and sublimely
they died.
</p><p>
They fell in the fierce conflict, amid the cheers, the
fire, the smoke, the flame, soothed in the dying hour
by the consciousness that victory came to side of right
and truth and liberty, and that "Old Glory" still
waved triumphantly. They have pitched their tents,
in the eternal bivouac beyond the stars, and are camped
in the mysterious and unknown silence of the life
immortal.
</p><p>
Oh, unconquerable heroes! Let it never be said
that the great republic is forgetful of your deeds, or
unmindful of those whom you most loved.
</p><p>
Finally, my Comrades, let us fight valiently, on all
the stern battle-fields of this life, so that, when the last
tattoo is beaten, and 'lights out' forever, we shall be
worthy to join the immortal ranks of the comrades on
the other side, and march before the Great Reviewing
officer, when time and earth and hostile armies are
no more forever.</p>
